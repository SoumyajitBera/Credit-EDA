# Credit EDA Analysis

## Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit-related dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and identify relationships within the data. The notebook is designed to provide an in-depth analysis that can assist in understanding the underlying structure of the dataset and preparing it for further modeling or business decision-making.

---

## Project Structure

### Notebook
- **`credit_eda_analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
  - Exploratory data visualizations
  - Statistical summaries
  - Correlation analysis
  - Key insights from the dataset

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is related to credit data. It contains various features such as customer demographic details, credit history, and other relevant attributes.

### Data Description:
- **Columns**:
  - [Provide a brief description of the key columns in the dataset, such as `Age`, `Income`, `Credit Score`, `Loan Amount`, etc., based on your data].
- **Missing Values**:
  - Missing value handling and imputation techniques are discussed and implemented.
- **Target Variable**:
  - Specify the dependent variable if the analysis involves supervised learning preparation (e.g., `Default`, `Credit Risk`).

---

## Key Features of the Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of duplicate entries
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables (if applicable)
   - Normalization/standardization of numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Distribution plots for numerical variables
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
   - Comparison of categorical variables

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - New feature creation (if any)
   - Feature selection for modeling (optional)

4. **Insights and Observations**:
   - Key findings from the data analysis
   - Business implications or recommendations based on the data

---

## Visualizations
This notebook contains a variety of visualizations to enhance understanding:
- **Histograms**: For exploring the distribution of numerical features.
- **Boxplots**: For identifying outliers.
- **Scatter Plots**: To study relationships between pairs of features.
- **Heatmaps**: For correlation analysis.
- **Bar Charts**: For categorical variable analysis.
